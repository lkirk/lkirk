### lkirk

Hello, I'm Lloyd.
In my professional life, I spend my time in the computational biology world, analyzing data and writing code.
In my personal life, I spend time tinkering with programming language design, programming languages I want to learn, operating systems, window managers, and side-projects for work (as of late, I've been focusing on container technologies).
Some of my code (especially the newer stuff) has a license.
If you have any questions about licensing, etc. please reach out.
